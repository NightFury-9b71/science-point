// TeacherAttendance Component Hooks Order Check
// 
// Fixed hooks order:
// 1. useNavigate() - ✅ Always called
// 2. useAuth() - ✅ Always called  
// 3. useTeacherClasses() - ✅ Now called before conditional returns
// 4. useTeacherStudents() - ✅ Now called before conditional returns
// 5. useMarkAttendance() - ✅ Now called before conditional returns
// 6. useUpdateAttendance() - ✅ Now called before conditional returns
// 7. useState() calls (5 total) - ✅ Now called before conditional returns
// 8. useClassAttendance() - ✅ Now called before conditional returns
// 9. useEffect() calls (2 total) - ✅ Now called before conditional returns
//
// Issue was: Hooks 3-9 were being called AFTER conditional returns
// Fix: Moved all hooks to the top before any conditional logic
//
// React Hook Rules:
// - Always call hooks at the top level
// - Never call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
// - Hooks must be called in the same order every time
