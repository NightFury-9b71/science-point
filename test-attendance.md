# Attendance Auto-Absent Testing Guide

## Changes Made:

1. **Backend Improvements:**
   - Fixed attendance endpoint to check by class + date instead of just date
   - Added bulk attendance endpoint (`/admin/attendance/bulk`)
   - Better error handling for attendance conflicts

2. **Frontend Improvements:**
   - Auto-mark all students as "absent" by default when class/date is selected
   - Added immediate effect to ensure absent marking happens quickly
   - Visual indicators showing default absent status
   - Updated quick action buttons to show current state
   - Added attendance summary (Present/Absent counts)
   - Improved error handling and debugging

## Testing Steps:

1. **Navigate to Teacher Attendance page**
2. **Select a class** - All students should immediately be marked as "absent"
3. **Select a date** - Default absent status should be preserved
4. **Visual indicators should show:**
   - Orange message: "All students marked as ABSENT by default"
   - Quick action button: "All Absent (Default)" (disabled/highlighted)
   - Summary: Shows absent count = total students
   - Badge: "All marked absent by default"

5. **Mark some students present** - Counts should update dynamically
6. **Use quick actions:**
   - "Mark All Present" - Should mark everyone present
   - "Mark All Absent" - Should revert to absent (becomes disabled again)

7. **Submit attendance** - Should save to database properly
8. **Reload page and select same class/date** - Should load existing attendance

## Expected Behavior:
- ✅ All students default to "absent" immediately
- ✅ Visual feedback shows default state
- ✅ Teachers only need to mark "present" students
- ✅ Attendance saves to database correctly
- ✅ No loading states during first submission
- ✅ State preserved during submission
